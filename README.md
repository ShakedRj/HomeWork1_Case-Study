 ## *Founders & History*
  TransferWise was founded in 2011 by Taavet Hinrikus and kristo käärmann, they are both originally from Estonia. One day they met at a bar in London, they got talking and they realized they were complaining about the same issue. Tavvet was being paid in Euro while living in London so he needed pounds to pay the rent and kristo got paid in pounds but he had a mortgage in Estonia and so he needed euros. They each had the currency that the other one needed. Since they both had bank accounts in London and Estonia, they decided to help each other and exchange the money between themselves skipping the banks, saving a lot of time and money. They realized that this method of depositing transferring money can be useful to many people and can save them money so they created a platform that would allow these types of transactions occur on a much larger scale and this is how TransferWise was born.
