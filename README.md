# International transfers made simple.
 


 ## *Founders & History*
  TransferWise was founded in 2011 by Taavet Hinrikus and kristo käärmann, they are both originally from Estonia. One day they met at a bar in London, they got talking and they realized they were complaining about the same issue. Tavvet was being paid in Euro while living in London so he needed pounds to pay the rent and kristo got paid in pounds but he had a mortgage in Estonia and so he needed euros. They each had the currency that the other one needed. Since they both had bank accounts in London and Estonia, they decided to help each other and exchange the money between themselves skipping the banks, saving a lot of time and money. They realized that this method of depositing transferring money can be useful to many people and can save them money so they created a platform that would allow these types of transactions occur on a much larger scale and this is how TransferWise was born.

## *What is TransferWise and who is it for?*
TransferWise is a foreign exchange and money remittance company that targets a variety of people for instance, individuals living abroad, travelers and businesses that deal internationally. 

TransferWise’s main goal is to make international money transfers cheap, transparent, fair, and simple. Until TransferWise came around, transferring money internationally was expensive, time-consuming, the rates and fees were unclear and, in most cases, going to a physical location was necessary to receive money.  

TransferWise charges a set percentage rate on a transaction which is clearly stated before you pay. The company uses the internationally recognized exchange rate at the time of payment, which can be easily verified by a quick internet search. The website and phone application are very straightforward, setting up an account is quick and connecting a bank account or credit card is seamless. Payments may take up to one day but may vary depending on the currencies exchanged this is significantly less than most of the other options which can take over three days. 


 TransferWise provides a mobile app that enables users to send money abroad at the real, current exchange rate and track transfers in their accounts. The market size for such a product was big to begin with and will only expand and continue to grow based on the fact that traveling is becoming cheaper and more accessible with time, businesses are expanding to the international market and more people live and/or study abroad. This may eventually become a necessity in almost every house.

They offer very low fees for wiring money internationally; they offer speed and convenience that banks don't offer. 

## *The secret behind TransferWise*
TransferWise established bank accounts in many countries, this allows them to skip the international costly transaction by making two low-cost local transactions. This innovative method of transferring money makes this company more competitive against well-known banks. Revenues of a major bank are marginally impacted by the international transfers sector and don’t focus their efforts on competing in this area. The banks have loyal customers that might take a more expensive way to transfer money but TransferWise is looking to focus on international money transfers this way they can focus on making this service as efficient and profitable as possible. 

## *Landscape*
TransferWise is a part of the Payments/Billing domain of the financial industry, we see a massive change in this domain. Over the past 10 years due to the advance of technologies online payments and transfers have become ubiquitous. This incentivized companies to invest in the research and development of profitable technologies. Many types of technologies focus on the ease of payment methods whether it be Google chrome with storing credit card information, Apple with Apple Pay\Cash or Chase with Zelle (QuickPay). Another focus is the security part of payment methods, in the beginning people were reluctant to send money to others over the internet so companies focused on proving that their software won’t get hacked and now it's fair to say that online transactions are safe and secure.   

Paying online allows performing routine tasks such as paying utilities and bank statements simpler. Paying bills online also has the benefit of immediate response, so if a bill is due on a specific day the payment can be made on the same day. With TransferWise and important tool has been added by allowing international payments through different currencies. This allows a user to be less likely to miss a payment due to logistical disadvantages.   

Self-checkout is an important payment method in the retail market. Customers using the self-checkout booth can save large grocery or pharmacy chains significant costs for payroll and can give the customer a smoother experience by cutting down on wait times. A new type of payment system that is being implemented is one that Amazon is using in their Amazon GO stores, where the customer signs in to the Amazon GO phone app and enters the store with a QR code that allows them to take whatever they want and with new technology the app shows the receipt of what the customer bought. This new type of grocery store makes the payment phase of buying groceries feel almost non-existent, this may carry on to other types of retail markets as well. 

Some of the other major companies in this domain are:
