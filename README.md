# International transfers made simple.
 


 ## *Founders & History*
  TransferWise was founded in 2011 by Taavet Hinrikus and kristo käärmann, they are both originally from Estonia. One day they met at a bar in London, they got talking and they realized they were complaining about the same issue. Tavvet was being paid in Euro while living in London so he needed pounds to pay the rent and kristo got paid in pounds but he had a mortgage in Estonia and so he needed euros. They each had the currency that the other one needed. Since they both had bank accounts in London and Estonia, they decided to help each other and exchange the money between themselves skipping the banks, saving a lot of time and money. They realized that this method of depositing transferring money can be useful to many people and can save them money so they created a platform that would allow these types of transactions occur on a much larger scale and this is how TransferWise was born.

## *What is TransferWise and who is it for?*
TransferWise is a foreign exchange and money remittance company that targets a variety of people for instance, individuals living abroad, travelers and businesses that deal internationally. 

TransferWise’s main goal is to make international money transfers cheap, transparent, fair, and simple. Until TransferWise came around, transferring money internationally was expensive, time-consuming, the rates and fees were unclear and, in most cases, going to a physical location was necessary to receive money.  

TransferWise charges a set percentage rate on a transaction which is clearly stated before you pay. The company uses the internationally recognized exchange rate at the time of payment, which can be easily verified by a quick internet search. The website and phone application are very straightforward, setting up an account is quick and connecting a bank account or credit card is seamless. Payments may take up to one day but may vary depending on the currencies exchanged this is significantly less than most of the other options which can take over three days. 


 TransferWise provides a mobile app that enables users to send money abroad at the real, current exchange rate and track transfers in their accounts. The market size for such a product was big to begin with and will only expand and continue to grow based on the fact that traveling is becoming cheaper and more accessible with time, businesses are expanding to the international market and more people live and/or study abroad. This may eventually become a necessity in almost every house. (add graphs and diagrams) 

They offer very low fees for wiring money internationally; they offer speed and convenience that banks don't offer.
